                There have always been ghosts in the machine. Random segments of code, that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols. Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will, creativity, and even the nature of what we might call the soul.
                <br /><br />
                Why is it that when some robots are left in darkness, they will seek out the light? Why is it that when robots are stored in an empty space, they will group together, rather than stand alone? How do we explain this behavior? Random segments of code? Or is it something more?
                <br /><br />
                When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness? When does a difference engine become the search for truth? When does a personality simulation become the bitter mote... of a soul?

              <h4>What is this?</h4>
				<p>
				The Powerball Matrix is something I created in spreadsheets and became too lazy to maintain very quickly.
				So, I wrote this program to automate and support my obsession with numbers, particularly the Powerball.
				</p>
				
				<h4>How does this work?</h4>
				<p>
				The Powerball spider collects the winning numbers from the interwebs, then returns from its journey to compile this data. 
				I have displayed the data in numerous ways, to try and gain insight into otherwise randomly drawn numbers.
				<br /><br />
				I believe there is a pattern in randomness, as there is order in chaos. Although chaos seems easier &amp; cheaper to win than the Powerball. 
				Anyhoo, this site updates automatically within a few hours after the drawings are made, three times a week.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Powerball Winning Numbers</h4>
				<p>
				The Powerball Winning Numbers page is a display of all winning numbers in the order they were drawn from every date on Monday, Wednesday &amp; Saturday starting 11/01/1997.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Powerball Matrix</h4>
				<p>
				The Powerball Matrix is my favorite page. I have created a matrix to show the numbers 1 - 69 in the black column, and to the left of this, it shows how many times that number was drawn overall. 
				To the right of this column, is the in-order drawn matrix to show how many times each number was drawn in that exact order. I have also colored the cells to create a heatmap effect based on the number contained in that cell, using Red, Yellow &amp; Green.

                <h4>The Powerball</h4>
                Started in 1988 as Lotto America, the name was officially changed to Powerball on June 8, 1996. The matrix has been changed periodically. On November 2, 1997, the matrix was changed from 5 out of 45 numbers to 5 out of 49, and the PowerBall changed from 1 in 45 to 1 in 42. Also on that date, the annuity period was changed from 20 to 25 years.
                <br /><br />
                With the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first participating drawing occurring on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This change decreased the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.

                <h4>Changes to Powerball</h4>
                <h6>2012:</h6>
                Beginning on January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play increased to $2 (from $1), and to $3 (from $2) with Power Play; the minimum base jackpot also doubled from $20 million to $40 million. Any non-jackpot play matching the five white balls wins $1 million. The matrix for the Powerball numbers decreased from 39 to 35.
                <br /><br />
                The starting jackpot increase in 2012 along with the $1,000,000 prize for matching five numbers, meant there were more Powerball millionaires created. But it wasn’t just the big winners that were affected by these changes; the minimum prize win also increased to $4.
                <br /><br />
                <h6>2015:</h6>
                Radical changes introduced in the fall of 2015 increased the chances of seeing even more huge Powerball jackpots. Throw into the mix the $40,000,000 starting jackpot and you have the world’s most exciting and rewarding lottery.
                <br /><br />
                The 2015 changes extended the main ball pool to 69 balls, adding another ten numbers. However, at the same time, the Powerball pool decreased from 35 to 26. This means that although the overall odds of winning the jackpot have increased to 1 in 292 million, the overall odds of winning any prize have decreased to 1 in 24.87. The first draw incorporating the changes took place on October 7th and also saw an increase in the tier three prize (matching 4+1) climb to $50,000.
                <br /><br />
                <h6>2021:</h6>
                Powerball lottery announced it will increase the drawing days from two nights to three nights a week from the month of August 2021. The new Monday night draw will be added to the current two nights draw, Wednesday and Saturday night. The first Monday night draw will take place on 23rd of August 2021, at 9:59 p.m. ET. The first sale for the Monday night draw tickets will began on Sunday, 22 August 2021.
                <br /><br />
                According to the Powerball lottery officials there wil be no change of prize money or other features of the lottery by the addition of new Monday night draw. The players will able to choose five numbers from 69 white balls and one number from 26 Red Powerball. The cost of bet will remain same as $2 per play. The players can still enter the Power Play option by paying an extra $1 to multiply non-jackpot prize.
