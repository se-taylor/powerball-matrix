## Overview

The Powerball Matrix is something I created in spreadsheets and became too lazy to maintain very quickly. So, I wrote this program to automate and support my obsession with numbers, particularly the Powerball.

The Powerball spider collects the winning numbers from the interwebs, then returns from its journey to compile this data. I have displayed the data in numerous ways, to try and gain insight into otherwise randomly drawn numbers.

Updates are automatically completed within a few hours after the drawings are made, three times a week.

### Features

| Feature                                | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wining Numbers  | The Powerball Winning Numbers page is a display of all winning numbers in the order they were drawn from every date on Monday, Wednesday & Saturday starting 11/01/1997.  |
| Matrix  | The Powerball Matrix page is showing the numbers 1 - 69 in the black column, and to the left of this, it shows how many times that number was drawn overall. To the right of this column, is the in-order drawn matrix to show how many times each number was drawn in that exact order. I have also colored the cells to create a heatmap effect based on the number contained in that cell, using Red, Yellow & Green.  |
| Averages  | The Averages page is showing a matrix of the winning numbers averages.  |
| Monday  | The Monday page is showing a matrix of winning numbers and their averages restricted to Monday only.  |
| Wednesday  | The Wednesday page is showing a matrix of winning numbers and their averages restricted to Wednesday only.  |
| Saturday  | The Saturday page is showing a matrix of winning numbers and their averages restricted to Saturday only.  |
| Miscellaneous  | The Miscellaneous page is similar to the Winning Numbers page, but it is showing other factors that may or may not have anything to do with anything.  |
| The New 10  | The New 10 page is showing a view of just the new balls that were added, 60 through 69. (Data Collection Since 10/07/2015)  |
| The 9 Less  | The 9 Less page is showing the remaining data from the removal of the Powerballs, 27 through 35. (Data Collection Until 10/07/2015)  |

## Browser Support

At present, I officially aim to support the last two versions of the following browsers:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Safari
* Opera
* Internet Explorer 9+

This is not to say that The Powerball Matrix cannot be used in browsers older than those reflected, but merely that my focus will be on ensuring our layouts work great in the above.

## Inspiration

Powerball, my obsession with numbers and my laziness to maintain spreadsheets.
